Quite often I forgot my remote, so just need something easy to open them without remote. Because I have regular “ring type” opener (click and release to open door) needed something to “click” door for me based on something which I remember (not own – remote / key / etc).
Basic idea – keypad + arduino + relay to click the button.</description></item></channel></rss>
