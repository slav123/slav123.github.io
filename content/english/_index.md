Quite often people ask me what I do for living, and I always struggle. Am I a programmer ? Web developer ? Software Engineer ? Software Architect ? Technical Lead ? Technical Director ? &#8211; I owned each of these titles among my carrier and still don&#8217;t know what is the best one. 

I think my best skill is _intuition_ &#8211; sometimes I just know what will be the bottleneck in software / setup or just know what is the best solution without testing it first.

Anyways &#8211; please check my [work][1] to see what actual problems I did solved&#8230;
