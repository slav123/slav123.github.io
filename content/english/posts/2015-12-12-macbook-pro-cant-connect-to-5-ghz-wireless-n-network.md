That one was tricky. Got brand new router and couldn&#8217;t connect to 5 Ghz network. My iPhone didn&#8217;t have this issues, neither couple other devices at home. I spend some time randomly changing settings on wireless network, and then I found tricky information &#8211; my MacBook can&#8217;t use all available channels, can work only on specific one.

How to get list of available channels &#8211; just go to &#8220;Apple&#8221; on top left corner of your screen -> About this Mac -> System report&#8230;

and then change settings of router to work on one of Supported Channels:
