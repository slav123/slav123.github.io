Whenever people ask me about my job title and what I do for a living, I always struggle to answer. Am I a programmer, web developer, software engineer, solution architect, technical lead, or technical director? I've held each of these titles during my career, and I'm still not sure which one fits me best.

However, what I do know is that I leverage my 20 years of experience and excellent intuition to solve problems. So, please take a look at [my work][1] and see the actual problems I have solved.
