I've got this client which is each year asking me to renew their SSl certificate. It’s EV, so it requires a little more paperwork, and a new lady from the office was helping with the process. After three weeks of pushing scans and talking with Indians, we finally got a certificate. I replaced the old one and sent an e-mail that it’s up and running.
She asked me to send her a copy - I thought - it was a good point. They can have a backup in case of my death. So wrapped it up in a ZIP file and sent it to her. She replied that she couldn’t open the file - can I make it a PDF! Apparently, an SSL certificate is a Certificate they can be put into a frame and hung on the wall ;)
