Whenever people ask me about my job title and what I do for a living, I always struggle to answer. Am I a software engineer? A solution architect? A technical lead? A technical director?  

However, what I do know is that I leverage my 20 years of experience and excellent intuition to solve problems. So, please take a look at [my work][1] and see the actual problems I have solved.
