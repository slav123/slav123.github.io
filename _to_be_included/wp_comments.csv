I tried these on my iMac running 10.6.8. It work fine until I restarted my computer. After that is caused a kernel panic and crashed my computer when either clone was connected. After several hours I found the offending file that was installed and removed it. It was System/Library/Extensions/usb.kext
My system doesn't crash now but also doesn't see the Arduino clones. The same driver installed on a MacBook running 10.9.5 works just great.
