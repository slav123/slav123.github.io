People often ask me what my job title is and what I do for a living, and I always struggle. Am I a programmer? Web developer? Software Engineer? Solution Architect? Technical Lead? Technical Director? &#8211; I owned each of these titles in my carrier and still don&#8217;t know the best one.

I solve problems using my 20 years of experience and excellent intuition.

Anyways &#8211; please check my [work][1] to see what actual problems I did solved&#8230;
