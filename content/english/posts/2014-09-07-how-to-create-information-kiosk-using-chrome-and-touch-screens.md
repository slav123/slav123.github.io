While ago I was working in company called Imagination. I&#8217;ve done some very cool projects while I was working there, and this is history off one of them.

### Challenge

We were ask to create interactive solution to show case history of the oil company, for exhibition. Something really simple and inexpensive. We made information &#8220;kiosks&#8221; where people could browse history of the company.

### Solution

As a solution I chose already known and quite easy technology &#8211; HTML5. As a hardware we had just 2 regular 32&#8243; touchscreen monitors. To power monitors we use PC desktops running Windows. To server content &#8211; Raspberry Pi &#8211; because both content on the screens had to be synchronized.
