Recently I bought very cheaply Arduino UNO Clone called **DccEle &#8211; DCcduino UNO**. Be default It wasn&#8217;t recognized by my Mac OS. After a quick google search, I found this [article](http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=261375.0) which pointed me to proper drivers.

If you are not afraid, just pull drivers from this website [www.5v.ru](http://www.5v.ru/ch340g.htm) or this one [www.wch.cn](http://www.wch.cn/downloads.php?name=pro&proid=178). You can also pull copies from here:

  * [ch341ser_mac(v12)][1] 
  * [ch341ser_mac(v13)][2]
  * [CH341SER_MAC][3]

All you need to do is just to install them &#8211; reboot computer &#8211; the new device will appear on your device list:

And obviously you can upload blink code to your new device:
