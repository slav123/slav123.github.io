Quite often I forgot my remote, so just need something easy to open them without remote. Because I have regular ‚Äúring type‚Äù opener (click and release to open door) needed something to ‚Äúclick‚Äù door for me based on something which I remember (not own ‚Äì remote / key / etc).
Basic idea ‚Äì keypad + arduino + relay to click the button.</description></item><item><title>USB to TTL / Serial MacOS Mojave</title><link>/usb-to-ttl-serial-macos-mojave/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 14:44:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>/usb-to-ttl-serial-macos-mojave/</guid><description>Got a bunch of these little f*ckers and couldn‚Äôt make them to work with my Mojave fresh install.

&lt;p>It was my first Arduino project so the task wasn‚Äôt ¬†as easy as I expected. In the theory, we need only pass time &amp;amp; data from RTC to 7-Segment Display. Simple isn‚Äôt it? I found plenty of tutorials, had so many small issues like ‚Äì digits wasn‚Äôt displayed correctly (mixed cables). I could only display one digit at the time in given position or ‚Äì same digits everywhere (multiplexing). I couldn‚Äôt find shift register in my stock, so wanted to use whatever I already had.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Facebook APP ‚Äì photo competition for AMEX</title><link>/facebook-app-photo-competition-for-amex/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 06:43:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>/facebook-app-photo-competition-for-amex/</guid><description>&lt;p>Amex Picture This ‚Äì Facebook application build for American Express while working for Imagination.&lt;/p>
